# Memory Mix

[**Memory Mix**] is an tool for DJs, designed to help rediscover songs in large digital collections. With a flashcard-like approach, Memory Mix allows DJs to cycle through tracks they might not frequently listen to, offering inspiration for new sets and mixes.


## Getting Started

To get started, visit [Memory Mix](https://www.memorymix.cards), point it at a directory containing MP3, FLAC etc and it will recursively parse all the files. It will generate cards on the fly in using the browser so no uploading to a server, it could happily run locally!

## Development & Contributing

All current depenencies are loaded from a CDN, so all you should need to get started is in index.html. It is a basic project with lots of scope for improvement and we gladly welcome contributions to make it more useful for your flow! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
